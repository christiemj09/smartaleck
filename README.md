# Introduction

A PL/Python wrapper for scikit-learn.

# Challenges

* Don't want to have to code a bunch of wrappers by hand. Is there a way to auto-generate these?
* What's the best interface you can achieve between the scikit-learn code and SQL?
* Best practices for saving and retrieving model parameters in the database? Perhaps look to `cookbook`?
